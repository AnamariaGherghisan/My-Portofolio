                <h2>About Anamaria</h2>
                <img src="assets/img/me.jpg" alt="Anamaria Gherghisan, smiling">
                <p>Hi,there! I'm Anamaria, a lifelong learner currently taking a course and exploring the exciting world
                    of
                    Frontend Development with Purple Beard Training.
                    My course-work and theory lies within frontend web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack are
                    JavaScript,
                    React, and of course HTML/CSS. While I may not have any
                    direct experience in this field, my previous roles have all equipped me with valuable skills
                    such as attention to detail, problem-solving, and the ability to work well under pressure. </p>
                <p>I also have an educational-background in Chemist Laboratory Technology and Mass-Media and Journalism,
                    which has honed my communication and creativity skills that will come in handy for
                    designing aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interfaces. </p>
                <p>When I'm not bent over my computer, perfecting my coding skills and designing beautiful websites, you
                    may
                    find me binge-watching documentaries
                    or cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Oh, and did I mention that I have a talent for cracking puns?
                    So
                    be prepared to groan
                    along with my terrible jokes as we work together on our next project.</p>
