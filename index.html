            <img src="assets/img/me.jpg" alt="Anamaria Gherghisan, smiling">
            <p>Hi there, I'm Anamaria, a student currently exploring the exciting world of Frontend Development with PurpleBeard Training.My coursework expertise
lies within front-end web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS.</p><p> While I may not have any direct 
              experience in this field, my previous roles as a packer/picker in a factory, a warehouse operative,assembly operative, machinist and valeter
              (car cleaner) have all equipped me with valuable skills such as attention to detail,problem-solving, and the ability to work 
              well under pressure.</p>
            <p>I also have a educational background in mass-media and journalism in university and laboratory technician in high-school, which has honed my communication 
              and creativity skills that will come in handy for designing aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interfaces. </p>
            <p>When I'm not bent over my computer, perfecting my coding skills and designing beautiful websites, you may find me binge-watching documentaries 
              or cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Oh, and did I mention that I have a talent for cracking puns? So be prepared to groan 
              along with my terrible jokes as we work together on our next project.</p>
            <p>So if you're ready to give me the opportunity to take my frontend development skills to the next level, let's get started! </p>
